# Microservice Architecture in ASP.NET 6

This is an eCommerce project with Microservice Architecture that demonstrates usage of design patterns & many technologies.

Each service uses its own different sub-architecture and database to demonstrate true microservices and their potential. 
I have mainly used clean and layerd as sub-architecutres for each of the service. 
To achive fast respons from database I used NoSQL such as MongoDB and Redis (as DB), and for more solid and scalable databases I used MS SQL & PostgreSQL.

Project demonstrates use of DDD, Repository/CQRS with Mediator pattern in persistance and buissenes layers to access database layer and persist data. 

Finally to agregate all the services and allow users to access them uniformly I used Ocelot gateway together with many features that it provides (Caching, Req. Limiting, Load Balancing, Security, ...)
