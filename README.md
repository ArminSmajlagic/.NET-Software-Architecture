# Microservice Architecture in ASP.NET 6

This is an eCommerce project with Microservice Architecture implementation with aid from design patterns & many technologies.

Each service uses its own sub-architecture and database. 
I have selected clean and layerd as sub-architecutres. 
To achive fast respons from database I used NoSQL such as MongoDB and Redis, and where I needed strong solid base between entities I used MS SQL & PostgreSQL.

It uses DDD, Repository/CQRS with Mediator pattern in persistance and buissenes layer to access database layer and persist data. 

Finaly to agregate all the services and allow users to access them uniformly i used Ocelot gateway together with many features that it provides (Caching, Req. Limiting, Balancing, Security, ...)
